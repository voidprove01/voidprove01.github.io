        <!-- About Me -->
        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
           I am a final-year PhD candidate in Economics at Carnegie Mellon University,Tepper School of Business. My work combines economic modeling with applied machine learning and causal inference to study how algorithms and incentives shape outcomes in digital marketplaces.

        </p>

        <p>
            I bring this perspective into practical decision-making in industry. Previously, I interned on ByteDance’s E-Commerce Governance & Experience team, where I worked on large-scale experimentation, uplift modeling, and policy evaluation using platform log data.
        </p>

        <p>
            Before my PhD, I received my M.A. in Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences from Columbia 
            University and my B.A. in Philosophy(Logic track) and Economics from Peking University.

          <summary><strong>Merchant Lifetime Prediction & Uplift evaluation of GnE Cost@ ByteDance</strong></summary>
          <p>
            Developed and deployed a multi-task ML system to forecast merchant lifetime and estimate 
            causal impact of experience-related costs, trained on multi-terabyte transaction-level data. 
            Automated end-to-end daily data ingestion, retraining, and dashboard updates, improving forecast 
            accuracy by about 10%, supplying key coefficients to the ROI framework to quantify long-term merchant outcomes and evaluate governance strategies.

            quantifies the long-term ROI of governance policies.Estimated an upper bound of governance intensity beyond which long-term GMV loss is likely, providing quantitative guardrails for sustainable strategy design.          </p>

            This paper develops a model of how personalization, consumer privacy choices, and price discrimination interact 
            in competitive search markets. Offers insights into how information design and cookie policies 
            affect user experience, prices, and marketplace efficiency.

<summary><strong>Algorithms at the Gate: The Quality–Variety Trade-off under Algorithmic Content Curation</strong></summary>
<p>
  This paper develops a framework for how platforms design screening thresholds and algorithmic accuracy when sellers behave strategically. 
  I show how these choices shape the trade-off between quality and variety, and how the platform’s ability to commit—and the intensity of internal 
  and external competition—changes the optimal level of governance.

  <summary><strong>Does Better Recommendation Lead to Faster Sales? Evidence from a C2C E-commerce Platform (Work in Progress)</strong></summary>
  <p>
    This paper develops embedding-based item similarity metrics and a recommendation density index to study how candidate retrieval quality shapes marketplace outcomes. 
    Disentangles acceleration and comparison-shopping effects by leveraging heterogeneity in price elasticity, and models time-to-sale dynamics using item-level conversion and hazard models.  </p>

          <summary><strong>Agent-based Modelling of Opinion & Relationship Dynamics</strong></summary>
          <p>
Developed an agent-based model to study the co-evolution of opinions and social ties in dynamic networks. Using simulations on real-world social networks (including Facebook ego data), demonstrated that global consensus is robust to network structure at high tolerance levels, while low tolerance leads to endogenous polarization and social segregation—even in well-connected networks.</p>

 <details>
  <summary><strong>Autonomous causal measurement agent</strong></summary>
  <p>
    Designed and implemented an agentic system that autonomously formulates causal estimands, selects identification strategies (e.g., difference-in-differences), and orchestrates multi-step measurement workflows using LLMs.
    The agent performs diagnostic checks (e.g., parallel trends), evaluates the credibility of estimated effects, and iteratively refines measurement decisions or recommends experimentation when observational evidence is insufficient.  </p>
</details>        <details>
  <summary><strong>Two-Stage Recommendation System: ANN Retrieval and Learning-to-Rank</strong></summary>
  <p>
    Built a two-stage recommendation pipeline combining embedding-based candidate retrieval with a supervised
    ranking model. Implemented ANN similarity search to retrieve high-quality user–item candidates at scale, and 
    trained a feature-rich learning-to-rank model to re-rank articles for 300K+ users and 360K+ items. Improved 
    recommendation relevance by integrating user histories, content embeddings, and interaction features.

          <summary><strong>Dynamic Pricing of For-Hire Vehicles via Reinforcement Learning</strong></summary>
          <p>
            Developed a reinforcement learning environment using NYC For-Hire Vehicle trip data to simulate 
            platform supply–demand dynamics. Trained pricing agents under uncertainty to optimize driver 
            earnings, illustrating the use of RL for economic decision-making and policy optimization.

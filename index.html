        <!-- About Me -->
        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
            I am a final year PhD candidate in Economics from Carnegie Mellon University, Tepper School of Business.
            My work combines economic theory with applied machine learning and causal inference 
            to understand and optimize large-scale platform behaviors. I study how algorithms, incentives, 
            and policy interventions shape outcomes in marketplaces, and I bring this perspective into 
            practical decision-making in industry.
        </p>

        <p>
            Previously, I have interned at ByteDance/TikTok's Platform Governance and Experience team, where I worked on large-scale experimentation, uplift modeling, and policy evaluation using platform log data. My applied work is grounded in the theoretical tools I use to understand incentives, strategic behavior, and information design in marketplaces.
        </p>

        <p>
            Before my PhD, I received my M.A. in Quantitative Methods (Data Science track) from Columbia 
            University and my B.A. in Philosophy and Economics from Peking University.

          <summary><strong>Merchant Lifetime Forecasting & Governance Uplift Modeling @ ByteDance/TikTok</strong></summary>
          <p>
            Developed and deployed a multi-task causal ML system to forecast merchant lifetime and estimate 
            uplift from governance-related experience costs, trained on multi-terabyte transaction-level data. 
            Automated end-to-end daily data ingestion, retraining, and dashboard updates, improving forecast 
            accuracy by about 10% and operationalizing predictions across millions of merchants. 
            The project was selected for presentation at a company-wide e-commerce data science forum.

          <summary><strong>Strategy Impact Surface for Platform Governance @ Bytedance/Tiktok</strong></summary>
          <p>
            Combined platform-scale A/B experimentation with causal-model insights to build a framework that 
            quantifies the long-term ROI of governance policies. Mapped nonlinear trade-offs between user experience 
            and seller retention and identified high-leverage governance intensities, informing policy decisions 
            for product and operations teams.

          <p>
            Built a two-stage recommender system using public news datasets, combining ANN-based candidate retrieval 
            with ML ranking models for 300k users and 360k articles. Demonstrates end-to-end recommender development,

            Developed a reinforcement learning environment using NYC For-Hire Vehicle trip data to simulate 
            platform supply–demand dynamics. Trained pricing agents under uncertainty to optimize driver 
            earnings, illustrating the use of RL for economic decision-making and policy optimization.

            Implemented a multi-agent simulation on hybrid and Facebook network data to model belief updating and relationship rewiring as ideological distance changes. Demonstrated emergent social dynamics—including polarization, homophily, and network fragmentation—that later motivated my interest in user and network dynamics on large-scale social platforms.          </p>

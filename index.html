        <!-- About Me -->
        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
            I am a data scientist with a PhD in Economics from Carnegie Mellon University.
            My work combines theoretical modeling with applied machine learning and causal inference 
            to understand and optimize large-scale platform behaviors. I study how algorithms, incentives, 
            and policy interventions shape outcomes in marketplaces, and I bring this perspective into 
            practical decision-making in industry.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have hands-on industry experience at ByteDance/TikTok, Uber, and Duolingo, where I worked on 
            experimentation, uplift modeling, ranking and recall systems, and policy evaluation using 
            large-scale log data. My applied work is informed by the theoretical tools I use to think 
            about incentives, screening, and algorithmic design.
        </p>

        <p>
            Before my PhD, I completed my M.A. in Quantitative Methods (Data Science track) at Columbia 
            University and my B.A. in Economics and Philosophy at Peking University.
            This background gave me strong foundations in quantitative analysis, formal reasoning, and 
            structured problem solving.

        <details open>
          <summary><strong>Merchant Lifetime Forecasting & Governance Uplift Modeling @ ByteDance/TikTok</strong></summary>
          <p>
            Developed and deployed a multi-task causal ML system to forecast merchant lifetime and estimate 
            uplift from governance-related experience costs, trained on multi-terabyte transaction-level data. 
            Automated end-to-end daily data ingestion, retraining, and dashboard updates, improving forecast 
            accuracy by about 10% and operationalizing predictions across millions of merchants. 
            The project was selected for presentation at a company-wide e-commerce data science forum.

          <summary><strong>Strategy Impact Surface for Platform Governance</strong></summary>
          <p>
            Combined platform-scale A/B experimentation with causal-model insights to build a framework that 
            quantifies the long-term ROI of governance policies. Mapped nonlinear trade-offs between user experience 
            and seller retention and identified high-leverage governance intensities, informing policy decisions 
            for product and operations teams.

          <p>
            Engineered features capturing operational uncertainty and marketplace behavior to enhance TikTok’s 
            merchant risk models; several features were adopted as production tags. Partnered with cross-functional 
            teams to scope and design new data signals to support governance and enforcement decisions.

        <h2>Selected Research</h2>

        <p>
            My research focuses on platform governance, algorithmic screening, and how incentives interact with 
            automated decision systems. Below are a few representative projects.
        </p>

        <details>
          <summary><strong>Algorithms at the Gate</strong></summary>
          <p>
            A modeling framework for how platforms set screening thresholds, how commitment or non-commitment 
            shapes seller incentives, and how automated screening trades off quality and variety. Provides 
            intuition for how algorithmic decision systems behave when agents can respond strategically.

            A theory of how personalization, consumer privacy choices, and price discrimination interact 
            in competitive search markets. Offers insights into how information design and cookie policies 
            affect user experience, prices, and marketplace efficiency.

          <summary><strong>Manipulable Signals</strong></summary>
          <p>
            Models how scoring algorithms respond when sellers can manipulate or game signal distributions, 
            and how commitment or coarsening can mitigate gaming incentives while preserving useful variation 
            in scores.

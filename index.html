        <!-- About Me -->
        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
           I am a final-year PhD candidate in Economics at Carnegie Mellon University (Tepper School of Business). My work combines economic modeling with applied machine learning and causal inference to study how algorithms and incentives shape outcomes in digital marketplaces.

        </p>

        <p>
            I bring this perspective into practical decision-making in industry. Previously, I interned on ByteDance’s E-Commerce Governance & Experience team, where I worked on large-scale experimentation, uplift modeling, and policy evaluation using platform log data.
        </p>

        <p>
            Before my PhD, I received my M.A. in Quantitative Methods (Data Science track) from Columbia 
            University and my B.A. in Philosophy and Economics from Peking University.

          <summary><strong>Merchant Lifetime Forecasting & Governance Uplift Modeling @ ByteDance</strong></summary>
          <p>
            Developed and deployed a multi-task causal ML system to forecast merchant lifetime and estimate 
            uplift of experience-related costs, trained on multi-terabyte transaction-level data. 
            Automated end-to-end daily data ingestion, retraining, and dashboard updates, improving forecast 
            accuracy by about 10% and operationalizing predictions across millions of merchants. 
            The project was selected for presentation at a company-wide e-commerce data science forum.

          <p>
            Combined platform-scale A/B experimentation with causal-model insights to build a framework that 
            quantifies the long-term ROI of governance policies. Mapped nonlinear trade-offs between user experience 
            and seller retention and identified high-leverage governance intensities, informing policy decisions 
            for product and operations teams.

            This paper develops a model of how personalization, consumer privacy choices, and price discrimination interact 
            in competitive search markets. Offers insights into how information design and cookie policies 
            affect user experience, prices, and marketplace efficiency.

<summary><strong>Algorithms at the Gate: The Quality–Variety Trade-off under Algorithmic Content Curation</strong></summary>
<p>
  This paper develops a framework for how platforms design screening thresholds and algorithmic accuracy when sellers behave strategically. 
  I show how these choices shape the trade-off between quality and variety, and how the platform’s ability to commit—and the intensity of internal 
  and external competition—changes the optimal level of governance.

  <summary><strong>Does Better Recommendation Lead to Faster Sales? Evidence from a C2C E-commerce Platform (Work in Progress)</strong></summary>
  <p>
    Better recommendations can speed up sales by reducing search frictions, but can also slow them down 
    by exposing buyers to more substitutes and encouraging comparison. I construct an embedding-based 
    recommendation density proxy from item metadata and use variation in product price elasticity to 
    separate these two channels—search-driven acceleration versus comparison-driven delay—and link the 
    resulting measure to sell-through speed and marketplace liquidity.

            This project developed and implemented a multi-agent simulated system on hybrid and Facebook network data to model belief updating and relationship rewiring as ideological distance changes. Demonstrated emergent social dynamics—including polarization, homophily, and network fragmentation—that later motivated my interest in user and network dynamics on large-scale social platforms.          </p>
